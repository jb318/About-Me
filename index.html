                    <p> 
                        It wasn't until a couple of years ago when I first got into programming and got my hands dirty coding when I took my first Computer Science class in college.  Before that, I had originally intended to major in Mechanical Engineering 
                        but that had only lasted until my second semester where I took my first Computer Science class, Intro to Computer Science for Engineers.  Despite being the most challenging class I took my first year, it was definitely the most enjoyable and 
                        interesting to me.  Ever since then my interest in Software Engineering, both Front-End and Back-End, has grown substantially.          
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to studying Software Development at Thinkful, I am also studying at Southern New Hampshire University with a major of Progamming for Game Developers and Design.  Aside from Web Development my other areas of interest lie in gaming 
                        and the development of application based entertainment.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm always looking for partners on any web development project as I want to expand on my portfolio and coding skills.  Feel free to contact me anytime if you are interested.
