                        It wasn't until a couple of years ago when I first got into programming and got my hands dirty coding when I took my first Computer Science class in college.  Before that, I had originally intended to major in Mechanical Engineering 
                        but that had only lasted until my second semester where I took my first Computer Science class, Intro to Computer Science for Engineers.  Despite being the most challenging class I took my first year, it was definitely the most enjoyable and 
                        interesting to me.  Ever since then my interest in Software Engineering, both Front-End and Back-End, has grown substantially.

                    <p>
                        In addition to studying Software Development at Thinkful, I am also studying at Southern New Hampshire University with a major of Progamming for Game Developers and Design.  Aside from Web Development my other areas of interest lie in gaming 
                        and the development of application based entertainment.

                        I'm always looking for partners on any web development project as I want to expand on my portfolio and coding skills.  Feel free to contact me anytime if you are interested.
