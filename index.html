                <h2><em>About Jack</em></h2>
                <p> 
                     It wasn't until a couple of years ago when I first got into programming and got my hands dirty coding when I took my first Computer Science class in college.  Before that, I had originally intended to major in Mechanical Engineering 
                     but that had only lasted until my second semester where I took my first Computer Science class, Programming for Engineers.  While being the most challenging class I took all of my first year, it was certainly the most enjoyable and 
                     interesting to me.  Ever since then my interest in programming, web development/software engineering, has grown substantially.          
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to studying software development at Thinkful, I am also studying Progamming for Game Developers and Design at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).  Considering I already love video games and am becoming more interest in 
                    coding I decided I'd major in Game Development so I can get a glimpse of the developers work load and potentially land my self a job in one of the many gaming studios.

                <p>
                    I'm always open to helping others on a web development project and would love the chance to collaborate with software engineers on all things programming related.  Feel free to contact me anytime.
